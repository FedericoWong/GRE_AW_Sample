> To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.

## 满分范文赏析

As public officials, leaders will influence society. Ethics and morals are widely accepted standards for members of a society to assess other members. I strongly agree that effective leaders who influence society should maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.

Although unique from laws, ethics and morality are considered subjective standards set forth by society. While the standards are subjective, they must still be regarded highly because of how commonly they are held. For instance, western and eastern countries view sexual morality separately, but in both of the cultures, it is commonly held that husband and wife should be loyal to each other. This is a widely accepted moral standard and in order to guarantee social stability, leaders in any society who adheres to these beliefs should, him or herself, uphold that code.

Public officials are compensated with money paid by citizens in the form of taxes. So, not only do public officials serve society, they represent society. As representatives, and in exchange for the opportunity to both serve and make a living, it should be required that public officials and leaders uphold the highest moral and ethical standards. If they do not maintain the highest ethical and moral standards, they will lose trust of the people and in turn lose their ability to effectively govern. Since ethics and morality are widely admired by society, they are good advisors to a public figure, for him to know what is and what is not acceptable in terms of behavior in office.

Nevertheless, such concerns do not mean all public officials should take care of their life in ethical and moral aspects under all situations. When it comes to some private and insignificant questions, public officials should have their freedom and human rights, just as any other member of society. The most important aim is to ensure that leaders will be good examples, will not make harmful decisions and will uphold the fabric of society.

In conclusion, upholding the highest ethical and moral standards should be a requisite for public officials. Society should carefully assess those it chooses to serve and represent them. Most importantly, society should be able to trust those individuals as good examples and pillars in the community.

## 满分要素剖析 

### 语言表达

1. Although unique from laws, ethics and morality are considered subjective standards set forth by society. 这句中的unique与from连用是很正确的，表示与…相比是独特的，与be different from的用法类似。此外，set forth是一个固定搭配，表示阐明，在这里可以理解为是社会中大家都懂，即公认的。 
2. So, not only do public officials serve society, they represent society. 虽然这句话没有明显地出现but also的字样，但前面的not only还是显示出这句话表达的是“不仅…还…”的意思，递进关系。 
3. If they do not maintain the highest ethical and moral standards, they will lose trust of the people and in turn lose their ability to effectively govern. 这句话里的短语in turn除了表示轮流、依次的意思之外，还表示“转而，反过来”，本句中即是后者的意思。 
4. The most important aim is to ensure that leaders will be good examples, will not make harmful decisions and will uphold the fabric of society. 这句话中的uphold一词在前文中也有出现。这是一个GRE词汇，表示支持、维护的意思，可以接抽象名词如决定、尊严、意见、规定等，也可以接具体名词如屋顶。 

### 逻辑结构

作者在写作本文时展示了其严谨完整的逻辑。他/她的观点是同意领导人应该保持最高的伦理道德标准。在论述中，作者给出了两点理由来支持观点，分别是第二段的从伦理道德标准出发，和第三段从领导人角度提出。作者认为伦理道德标准是社会公认的，需要领导人遵守；以及领导人是靠纳税人供养的，是大众选出的代表，应该以身作则。第四段作者退一步承认有些私人的和不重要的情况下，领导人可以和其他公民一样享有自由和人权。作文的结构是常见的总分总，首段和末段分别提出和总结了观点。
