> The following appeared in a memorandum from the manager of WWAC radio station: "To reverse a decline in listener numbers, our owners have decided that WWAC must change from its current rock-music format. The decline has occurred despite population growth in our listening area, but that growth has resulted mainly from people moving here after their retirement. We must make listeners of these new residents. We could switch to a music format tailored to their tastes, but a continuing decline in local sales of recorded music suggests limited interest in music. Instead we should change to a news and talk format, a form of radio that is increasingly popular in our area." Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

This memo recommends that WWAC radio station shift from rock-and-roll (R&R) music programming to news and talk programming. To support this recommendation the manager indicates that the number of WWAC listeners is decreasing while the number of older people in WWAC's listening area is increasing. The manager also points out that area sales of music recordings are in decline. Finally, the manager cites the success of news stations in nearby cities. Careful scrutiny of the manager's argument reveals several unproven assumptions, which render the argument unconvincing.

First, the manager assumes that the decline in the number of WWAC listeners is attributable to the station's current format. Perhaps the decline is due instead to WWAC's specific mix of R&R music, or to transmission problems at the station. Without ruling out these and other possible reasons for the decline, the manager cannot convince an audience that changing the format would reverse the trend.

Secondly, the manager's assumption that older people favor all-news programming is unsubstantiated. Perhaps WWAC listeners are dedicated R&R fans who will continue to prefer this type of programming as they grow older. Or perhaps as WWAC's regular audience ages, they will prefer a mix of R&R and news programming rather than one format to the total exclusion of the other. Besides, the number of young people in the listening area might be increasing as well. In short, the mere fact that the number of older people in WWAC's listening area is increasing suggests nothing about WWAC's best programming strategy.

Thirdly, a decrease in local music recording sales is scant evidence that WWAC should eschew music in favor of an all-news format. Although overall music sales are in decline, perhaps sales of R&R recordings are actually increasing. For that matter, perhaps people who buy music recordings are generally not the same people who listen to music on the radio. Either scenario, if true, would seriously undermine the manager's contention that WWAC should discontinue R&R programming.

Finally, it is unwarranted to infer from the success of all-news stations in surrounding areas that WWAC will also succeed by duplicating the same format. Those stations might well owe their success to their powerful transmitters, popular newscasters, or other factors. Besides, the very success of these stations suggests that the area's radio listeners might favor those well-established news providers over the fledgling all-news WWAC.

In sum, the evidence accomplishes little toward supporting the manager's argument for the proposed format shift. To further bolster the argument the manager must provide better evidence, perhaps by way of a reliable survey, that people within WWAC's listening area are becoming more interested in news and less interested in R&R music (or any other genre). The manager must also demonstrate that an all-news format would be more popular than a mixed format of music and news, and that a significant number of people would prefer WWAC's all-news programming to that of other stations in the listening area.
