> The following appeared in a memo from the marketing director of Bargain Brand Cereals: One year ago we introduced our first product, Bargain Brand Breakfast cereal. Our very low prices quickly drew many customers away from the top-selling cereal companies. Although the companies producing the top brands have since tried to compete with us by lowering their prices, and although several plans to introduce their own budget brands have been executed, not once have we needed to raise our prices to continue making a profit. Given our success selling cereal, Bargain Brand should now expand its business and begin marketing other low-priced food products as quickly as possible.

In this memo the marketing director of Bargain Brand Cereal claims that the company has a particular knack for selling low-priced food and will continue to make a profit should it follow the recommendation to expand from selling only cereal to other low-priced food. To support the recommendation, the memo points out that Bargain Brand is still earning a profit from its cereal sales, despite the fact that major competitors have lowered their cereal prices, and offered their own versions of bargain-priced cereal brands. The recommendation to expand is based on evidence that is not too convincing.  Let us review the argument.

First of all, while Bargain Brand is still earning a profit, a crucial point here is determining the extent to which Bargain Brand profits have diminished since other the introduction of alternative low-priced cereals hit the market. It is entirely possible that Bargain Brand has been less profitable since its competitors lowered their cereal prices, and that in a little more time, Bargain Brand will sink into the red.

Secondly, the memo states that several major competitors plan to offer their own special bargain brands to compete directly with Bargain Brand. Yet the memo fails to account for this fact m concluding that Bargain Brand will continue to be profitable. In all likelihood, after the introduction of competing brands Bargain Brand's profits will diminish even further. Without providing evidence that this will not occur, the director cannot convincingly conclude that Bargain Brand will continue to profit from its cereal sales.

Thirdly, based on the fact that Bargain Brand continues to profit from cereal sales, the memo concludes that Bargain Brand should expand its product line to include other low-priced food products. No evidence is provided whereby it is demonstrated that Bargain Brand is likely to be profitable in other markets.  Perhaps the profitability of the cereal is attributable so a factor that connote be replicated in the production of other low-food products.

In conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the recommendation is ridiculous. To strengthen the argument, the director must demonstrate that Bargain Brand will continue to profit from cereal sales long after its major competitors introduce their own bargain brands. To better assess the director's conclusion that Bargain Brand should expand its line of bargain-priced foods, an audience would need more information about why the cereal line is so successful in the first place and if this contributing factor can be reproduced in the production of other low-priced foods.
