> The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Parkville Daily Newspaper:
"Throughout the country last year, as more and more children below the age of nine participated in youth-league softball and soccer. Over 80,000 of these young players suffered injuries. When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league softball players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure from coaches and parents. Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities. Since the disadvantages apparently outweigh any advantages, we in Parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children under nine."

## 满分范文赏析

This letter concludes that Parkville should not allow children under age nine to participate in organized competitive sports because of the rate of injury, psychological pressure on children from adult organizers and the reduction in time available for academic pursuits.

One of the major problems with the argument is that it relies on the assumption that the nationwide statistics about the incidence of sports injuries among youngsters applies equally to Parkville's children—this might not be the case. Perhaps Parkville maintains more stringent safety standards than the national norm. Maybe children's sporting events in Parkville are better supervised. These peculiarities may offset the national averages. Without ruling out such possibilities, the author cannot justifiably conclude that Parkville has a sports-injury problem to begin with.

Another troubling issue is that the argument assumes that in Parkville parents and coaches unduly pressure youngsters to win organized athletic competitions. The only evidence the author provides to substantiate this assumption are the reports from "big city" children—there is no information present on the conditions in Parkville. Perhaps people who live in big cities are generally more competitive than other people. If so, and if Parkville is not a big city, then the author cannot justifiably rely on these reports.

A third problem with the argument is that it assumes that children do not benefit academically from participating in competitive sports. It is entirely possible that such sports provide children with a break from academics that helps them to be more productive academically. It is also possible that the competitive drive that these sports may instill in young children carries over to their academics and spurs them on in their studies. Without considering the potential academic benefits of organized sports, the author cannot reasonably conclude that for young children the disadvantages of participating in athletic competition outweigh the benefits.

In the end, even if the recommendation is a sensible on, the argument upon which it is based is too flimsy. To be able to further consider the recommendation, an audience would need more information about the incidence of sports injuries among young children in Parkville. Further, the argument must demonstrate that Parkville's parents and coaches exert psychological pressure that affects academics negatively.  Finally, the audience must be able to see the correlation between sports, academics, and overall student performance.
