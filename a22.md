> According to a recent report, cheating among college and university students is on the rise. However, Groveton College has successfully reduced student cheating by adopting an honor code, which calls for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton's honor code replaced a system in which teachers closely monitored students; under that system, teachers reported an average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without. Thus, all colleges and universities should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's in order to decrease cheating among students.

## 满分范文赏析

In this report the author concludes that colleges should adopt an honor code in order to reduce the frequency of cheating. To support this conclusion the author points out that the first year after switching from a monitoring system to an honor system the annual number of reported cheating incidents at Groveton College decreased from 30 (as reported by teachers) to 21 (as reported by students following the honor code) and that five years later the number decreased to 14. The author also cites a survey in which most students indicated they would be less likely to cheat under an honor system than if they are closely monitored. This argument is unconvincing for several reasons.

First and foremost, the argument relies on the assumptions that Groveton students are just as capable of detecting cheating as faculty monitors, and that these students are just as likely to report cheating whenever they observe it. However, without evidence to substantiate these assumptions one cannot reasonably conclude that the honor code has, in fact, resulted in a decline in the incidence of cheating at Groveton.

The argument also assumes that during the five-year period, all other conditions possibly affecting the reported incidence of cheating at Groveton remained unchanged. Such conditions include the number of Groveton students and the overall integrity of the student body. After five years it is entirely possible that these conditions have changed and that the reported decrease in cheating is attributable to one or more such changes. Thus, without ruling out such alternative explanations for the reported decrease, the argument fails to convince me that the honor code has, in fact, contributed to a decline in the incidence of cheating at Groveton.

Finally, the survey that the author cites might be unreliable in any of three respects: the author fails to assure us that the survey's respondents are representative of all college students, the survey results depend on the honesty and integrity of the respondents and hypothetical predictions about one's future behavior are inherently less reliable than reports of proven behavior. Lacking credible evidence from a reliable survey, the recommendation for the widespread adoption of the honor system becomes invalid.

In conclusion, to persuade an audience that other colleges should adopt an honor code in order to reduce cheating, the author must supply clear evidence that cheating at Groveton decreased after the honor code was instituted there, and that it is this code that was responsible for the decrease. Finally, to better assess the reliability of the survey an audience would need specific information about the survey's sampling methodology.
