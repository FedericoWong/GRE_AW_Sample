> No field of study can advance significantly unless it incorporates knowledge and experience from outside that field.

## 满分范文赏析

There are a lot of benefits of incorporating ideas from outside one’s field but this, by no means, indicates that outside knowledge and experience is a necessary condition predicating the successful performance of one’s specialized task.

Admittedly, borrowing knowledge and experience from other fields of study has indeed triggered significant breakthrough in many subjects. Quite a few, including biochemistry, economics, astronomy are undoubtedly the hybrids of subjects originally considered unrelated. One such breakthrough is the telescope, which was designed from amplifying tubes created for use by chemists. At first, the study of astray was limited in its development because of technological limitations. Then, a clever inventor used the amplifying tube to make a telescope. This invention signaled a changing point in the field of astronomy and thanks can be given to borrowing.

While it is wise to learn from outside experience, this does not indicate that it has necessarily predicates breakthrough. In physics and math, for example, it is difficult to mix with other sciences because they themselves are self-sufficient systems. For instance, Chen Jingrun, a mathematician, works for his whole life in solving the Goldbach Conjecture. However, the solution to such a puzzle was unknown until the day he died. There was no use in bringing information in from other fields in order to gain the answer. The solution simply required a lifetime of work and effort. So, borrowing is clearly not a predicate of breakthrough and advance.

Finally, there are a number of factors that contribute to development: long-term academic accumulation, the appropriate social and economic support, and even luck. All these factors can bring about a breakthrough and none of them rely on outside knowledge. For example, in America, the government emphasizes the importance of advancement in all fields by providing financial support. By these means can achievements be made.

All in all, we should consider many factors that contribute to advancement in any field, not just borrowing. In my opinion, significant progress in one's field can be attributed to a number of other factors as described above and bringing information or experience in from outside can sometimes prove fruitful and sometimes prove futile.

## 满分要素剖析

### 语言表达
 
1. There are …but this, by no means, indicates that outside knowledge and experience is a necessary condition predicating the successful performance of one’s specialized task. 这句话中的固定搭配by no means是“决不”的意思，作者特意在其前后加了逗号，单独地将它强调出来，以显示对indicates后面的宾语从句内容多么地不赞同。 
2. Quite a few, including biochemistry, economics, astronomy are undoubtedly the hybrids of subjects originally considered unrelated. 开头的quite a few意思不同于a few，它不表示“不多”，而是表示“相当多，很不少”，很多人容易将此搞混，应予注意。Quite a few是形容多而不是少！ 
3. For instance, Chen Jingrun, a mathematician, works for his whole life in solving the Goldbach Conjecture. 这句话中注意不要被for his whole life的语序影响了句意理解，补语for his whole life插在了works in solving…的works和in中间，而不是works for his whole life，his whole life作宾语。 
4. By these means can achievements be made. 这句话的方式状语by these means（means为单复数同形的名词）提前至句首了，因此谓语动词can放在了主语achievements的前面。 

### 逻辑结构

这道作文题认为除非吸收了其他领域的知识，否则一个学科不能取得进步。也就是说，只有吸收了外领域知识，一个学科才进步，前者是引起后者的必不可少的条件。但是作者认为，有了外界知识的帮助，一个学科可能进步也可能不进步；一个学科进步时，不一定依靠了外界知识的帮助。作者在总分总的框架下，在中间的“分”的几段中，提出了三个理由来论述自己的观点。首先，作者提出有些情况下，其他领域的知识是一个学科进步的理由；随后提出，不靠outside knowledge，有的学科也能自己取得突破；最后给出了促进一个学科进步的诸多其他理由。整个论述合起来完整地否定了题中的说法。
