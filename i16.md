> Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise. Others believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.

## 满分范文赏析

Today’s democratic structure is rooted in the ideas of ancient Greek philosophers. These men advocated for the respect of the individual beings and so they devised an electoral system which could represent the will of the people in government. Over time, the concept of democracy reigned in power and authority, and theoretically ended the age of totalitarianism. Driven by this trend, contemporary politicians are deprived of certain freedom in that they can no longer behave in the way they would like to. That is, being forced to simultaneously attend to a variety of ideological points of view restricts government leaders. In cases like these, it is possible that leaders must abandon principle for the sake of compromise. 

The key to success in democratic politics is to gain and maintain political power. Such power comes from certain identification of the public morality with the politician’s private one and the balance of different groups’ benefits and demands. Consequently, the politician’s attitudes, behavior and even the lifestyle are tightly restricted for fear that any departure from public’s taste may cause a loss of support. In today’s world, a successful politician may never enjoy the freedom enjoyed by the people he or she is meant to represent. 

On the contrary, in less democratic governments, leaders are afforded the opportunity to maintain a single party line whether it offends the people or not. While these leaders are often prone to abuses of power, they can more efficiently direct the path of a country and are never forced to make compromises that threaten founding principles.

In conclusion, I think that while abuse of power needs to be reigned in, it is better to be consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.  Democracy, as it is currently being practiced in countries like America, is too costly, financially and ideologically. Countries like China, wherein democracy is practiced within a single party, are not burdened with being forced to attend to special interests that challenge a country's founding principles and objectives.

## 满分要素剖析

### 语言表达

1. Driven by this trend, contemporary politicians are deprived of certain freedom in that they can no longer behave in the way they would like to. 这一句的driven是过去分词作为状语，表示主语contemporary politicians与drive（驱使、驱动）这个动词之间的被动关系。谓语动词deprive也采用了被动，表示实施这一动作的主体在此并不太重要，因为发生在主语contemporary politicians身上的结果才是强调的重点。In that在此表示因为、由于，比较书面化。
2. The key to success in democratic politics is to gain and maintain political power. 这句话中is后面的to引导的部分为不定式做表语，表明主语The key to success in democratic politics“是什么”，起表述作用。
3. Countries like China, wherein democracy is practiced within a single party, are not burdened with being forced to attend to special interests that challenge a country’s founding principles and objectives. 这一句的wherein引导了非限定性定语从句，表示in place where之意。Attend to这个短语用得很好，表示take care of和deal with两层意思。
